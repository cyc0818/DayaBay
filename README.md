# Data Pre-selection, Analysis, and Theoretical Calculations for Master's Thesis

This project contains the tools used for data pre-selection, analysis, fitting, and theoretical calculations in my master's thesis. These tools helped process large amounts of experimental data and perform theoretical model validation and simulation.

## Features

- **Data Pre-selection**: Cleaning and filtering raw data for muon veto and flasher cut.
- **Data Analysis**: IBD selection, Statistical analysis and visualization
- **Fitting**: Applying various statistical models (chi-square, maximum likelihood estimation) for data fitting.
- **Theoretical Calculations**: Simulating and calculating theoretical mode for neutron scattering.
